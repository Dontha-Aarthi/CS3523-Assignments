We have 3 c++ sources file

1. Assgn4-cas-CS20BTECH11015.cpp
	Command To compile: g++ Assgn4-cas-CS20BTECH11015.cpp -o cas -lpthread
	Command To run: ./cas
	
2. Assgn4-tas-CS20BTECH11015.cpp
	Command To compile: g++ Assgn4-tas-CS20BTECH11015.cpp -o tas -lpthread
	Command To run: ./tas
	
3. Assgn4-cas-bounded-waiting-CS20BTECH11015.cpp
	Command To compile: g++ Assgn4-cas-bounded-waiting-CS20BTECH11015.cpp -o casbw -lpthread
	Command To run: ./casbw


There is an inp-params.txt. And input parameters are read from this file by the above three source files 
and generate the output-log in cas.txt, tas.txt and cas-bounded-waiting.txt respectively.

I have printed the log in terminal also because sometimes the lines are not getting written into output-log files properly.
